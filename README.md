## Nav meshes

This repository contains navigation meshes that are used in the main project.

It is used as a git submodule, because it can contain large binary files. Even though it uses git LFS (large file storage), so that large files are actually small textual files, it still keeps git history for these files, and that could polute the git history of the main project.
